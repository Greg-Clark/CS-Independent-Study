/*
 Notes on game
 
 Mario's hit boxes when returned from getX run from -50 to 50 meaning that his image is printed from -0.05 to 0.05.
 Mario's getY position when on the floor is at -0.8
 
 The hitbox on the pipe will correctly hit mario when moving right when the pipe's position is at 50. It will correctly be hit when moving left when its postion is at -249
 Pipe Hitbox for getY is at -0.8
 next 3 pipes in the level will hit mario when at 49 when mario is moving right. When mario is moving left will hit at -250. I beleive that this inconsistancy could be due to floating point comparison errors.
 
 When trying to hit bricks/blocks from the left their getX needs to return 50, when trying to hit from the right their getX needs to return -149
